# Use Case: VLOOKUP with Gemini in Google Sheets

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

## Overview

VLOOKUP is a powerful function in Google Sheets that allows you to search for a specific value in a column and return a corresponding value from another column. However, constructing VLOOKUP formulas can be tricky and error-prone. Gemini can help you generate these formulas quickly and accurately, directly within your spreadsheet. This use case will guide you through leveraging Gemini to create a VLOOKUP formula, improving your efficiency and accuracy when working with data in Google Sheets.

## Steps

**1. Open a Google Sheet and click the Gemini icon in the side panel.**
* Go to your Google Sheet.
* Look for the Gemini icon in the right-hand side panel of your Google Sheet window.
* Click on the icon to open the Gemini interface.

**2. In the Gemini chat, type a prompt describing the VLOOKUP formula you want to create.**
* Be clear about the lookup value, the range containing the data, and the column index number of the return value.
* You can reference cells or ranges in your sheet directly within your prompt.
```markdown 
"Create a VLOOKUP formula that [clearly state the lookup value, the range containing the data, and the column index number of the return value]."

"I need to find a formula that looks up the value in [cell containing lookup value] in the table [range containing data]. When it finds a match, I want it to return the value from the [column number] column of the table."
```
```markdown
Example Prompts:
"Create a VLOOKUP formula that searches for the value in cell A2 in the range A:D and returns the corresponding value from the 4th column."
 
 "I need to find a formula that looks up the value in cell A2 in the table from column A to D. When it finds a match, I want it to return the value from the 4th column over."
 ```

**3. Gemini will generate a VLOOKUP formula based on your prompt.**
* Gemini will analyze your prompt and create a formula that matches your instructions.
* The formula will appear in the Gemini chat window.
* Here is an example of a VLOOKUP formula generated by Gemini:


**4. Review the formula and ask Gemini to make any necessary changes.**
* If you need to make any changes, ask Gemini to revise the formula.
* You can ask Gemini to adjust the formula to use a different lookup value, search range, or column index number.
* Examples of prompts to ask for changes

```markdown
"Can you modify this formula to search for the value in cell B2 instead?"
    
"Can you change this formula to search in the range B:E?"

"Can you adjust this formula to return the value from the 3rd column instead?"
```

**5. Once you're happy with the formula, copy and paste it into your Google Sheet.**
* When you're satisfied with the formula, copy it from the Gemini chat window.
* Paste the formula into the desired cell in your Google Sheet.
* Here is an example of the Google Sheet with the pasted VLOOKUP formula:
