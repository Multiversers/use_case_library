# CONCATENATE & COUNTIF with Gemini in Google Sheets

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 20 minutes

## Overview

CONCATENATE allows you to combine text from different cells, while COUNTIF counts the number of cells that meet a certain condition. Constructing these formulas can be repetitive and error-prone, especially when dealing with large datasets. Gemini can help you generate these formulas quickly and accurately, directly within your spreadsheet. This use case will guide you through leveraging Gemini to create CONCATENATE and COUNTIF formulas, improving your efficiency and accuracy when working with data in Google Sheets.

## Steps

**1. Access Gemini in Google Sheets**

* Open a Google Sheet.
* Look for the Gemini icon in the right-hand side panel of your Google Sheet window. [Opens in a new window](www.makeuseof.com) Gemini icon in Google Sheets
* Click on the icon to open the Gemini interface.

**2. Provide a Prompt to Gemini**

* In the Gemini chat, type a prompt describing the CONCATENATE or COUNTIF formula you want to create.
    * **For CONCATENATE:** Specify the cells or text strings you want to combine. You can also include separators or additional text within the formula.
    * **For COUNTIF:** Clearly state the range and the condition for counting cells.
    * You can reference cells or ranges in your sheet directly within your prompt.

* **Prompt Templates:**

```markdown 
"Create a CONCATENATE formula that [clearly state the cells or text strings you want to combine, including any separators or additional text]."

"Create a COUNTIF formula that [clearly state the range and the condition for counting cells]."
```

```markdown
Plain Language Prompts:
"I need a formula to combine the text in [cells or text strings] with [separators or additional text]."
" I need a formula to count how many cells in [range] meet the following condition: [condition]."
```
```markdown
Examples:
CONCATENATE Template: "Create a CONCATENATE formula that combines the values in cells A1, B1, and C1, separated by commas."

CONCATENATE Plain Language: "I need a formula to combine the text in cells A1, B1, and C1, and put a comma between each value."

COUNTIF Template: "Create a COUNTIF formula that counts the number of cells in the range A1:A10 that are greater than 50."

COUNTIF Plain Language: "I need a formula to count how many cells in the range A1:A10 have a value greater than 50."
```

**3. Review the Generated Formula**

* Gemini will analyze your prompt and create a formula that matches your instructions.
* The formula will appear in the Gemini chat window.
* Here is an example of a CONCATENATE and a COUNTIF formula generated by Gemini: 

**4. Refine the Formula with Gemini**

* If you need to make any changes, ask Gemini to revise the formula.
    * **For CONCATENATE:** You can ask Gemini to add or remove cells, change separators, or modify the order of concatenation.
    * **For COUNTIF:** You can ask Gemini to adjust the range, change the condition, or combine it with other functions.

```markdown
Examples:
CONCATENATE: "Can you modify this formula to also include the value in cell D1?"
COUNTIF: "Can you change this formula to count the number of cells that are less than 20?"
```
**5. Copy and Paste the Formula**

* Once you're happy with the formula, copy it from the Gemini chat window.
* Paste the formula into the desired cell in your Google Sheet.
* Here is an example of the Google Sheet with the pasted CONCATENATE and COUNTIF formulas:
