# Create a Presentation Outline with AI

**Estimated time to complete:** 20 minutes

**Description:** This use case guides you through the process of using an AI tool integrated with your presentation software to quickly generate a presentation outline based on your specified topic and goals. By automating the initial structuring of your presentation, you can **save time** and ensure a **well-organised starting point** for your content development.

## Steps:

**1. Open Your Presentation Software and Accompanying AI Tool.**

Ensure that your chosen presentation software (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint) is open and that the integrated AI tool (e.g., Gemini, Microsoft Copilot) is accessible. This might involve clicking an icon or using a specific command within the software.

**2. Provide Context to the AI Tool.**

Clearly articulate the key parameters of your presentation to the AI tool. This involves giving the AI information such as:

*   **The specific topic** you will be presenting on.
*   **The primary purpose or goal** of your presentation (e.g., to inform, to persuade, to train).
*   **Your target audience** and their level of knowledge on the topic.
*   **The desired tone** of your presentation (e.g., formal, informal, technical, engaging).
*   You can also specify preferences for **the desired length** (number of slides), **visual style**, and **types of content** you anticipate using (e.g., primarily text, incorporating images, requiring charts or diagrams).

**3. Generate the Presentation Outline.**

Instruct the AI tool to generate a presentation outline based on the context you have provided. For example, you might use a prompt like: "Create a presentation outline on \[Your Topic] for a \[Your Audience] with the goal of \[Your Goal]. Aim for approximately \[Number] slides and suggest incorporating \[Types of Content]." The AI will then analyse your input and generate a structured outline within the chat window or directly within your presentation software. This generated content may include:

*   **A title slide** suggestion, potentially with relevant visual ideas and placeholders for your main title and subtitle.
*   **A selection of potential slide layouts**, offering different structures for various content types (e.g., title and content, two content blocks, content with image).
*   **Sample headings and bullet points** as starting points for each section of your presentation, offering guidance on the flow and key messages.
*   Potentially, a **suggested design theme**, including font styles, colour palettes, and visual elements to create a consistent look and feel.

**4. Customise and Refine the Outline.**

Carefully review the AI-generated presentation outline. Adapt the outline to meet your specific needs and preferences by:

*   **Editing the existing slide titles and suggested content** to ensure accuracy and alignment with your detailed knowledge.
*   **Adding new slides** to cover additional points or to break down complex information further.
*   **Rearranging the order of the slides** to create a logical and engaging flow for your audience.
*   **Modifying the design elements**, such as fonts, colours, and images, to match your brand or preferred aesthetic.
*   **Adding specific instructions or prompts** within the slides to remind yourself of key points or visuals you want to include when you develop the full content.

**5. Save and Reuse the Outline.**

Once you are satisfied with the structure of your presentation outline, save it within your presentation software. This saved outline can serve as a valuable starting point for future presentations on similar topics, **saving you significant time** in the initial planning phase and helping to **maintain consistency** in your presentation style and structure. You can easily duplicate and adapt the outline for new content as needed.
