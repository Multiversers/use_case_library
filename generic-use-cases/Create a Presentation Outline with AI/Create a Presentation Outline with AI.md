# Create a Presentation Outline with Gemini

**Estimated time to complete:** 20 minutes

**Description:** This use case guides you through the process of using an AI tool integrated with your presentation software to quickly generate a presentation outline based on your specified topic and goals. By automating the initial structuring of your presentation, you can **save time** and ensure a **well-organised starting point** for your content development.

## Steps:

**1. Open Gemini and Your Presentation Software and Accompanying AI Tool.**

Ensure that your chosen presentation software (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint) is open. Access Gemini by going to https://gemini.google.com/ and logging in. Note that if you're using Google Slides, the Gemini is integrated with Google Slides. However, Gemini's website is a lot easier to use for this use case. 

**2. Provide Context to the AI Tool.**

Clearly articulate the key parameters of your presentation to the AI tool. This involves giving the AI information such as:

*   **The specific topic** you will be presenting on.
*   **The primary purpose or goal** of your presentation (e.g., to inform, to persuade, to train).
*   **Your target audience** and their level of knowledge on the topic.
*   **The desired tone** of your presentation (e.g., formal, informal, technical, engaging).
*   You can also specify preferences for **the desired length** (number of slides), **visual style**, and **types of content** you anticipate using (e.g., primarily text, incorporating images, requiring charts or diagrams).

**3. Submit Your Prompt to Generate the Presentation Outline.**

Instruct the AI tool to generate a presentation outline based on the context you have provided. For example, you might use a prompt like: 
> "Create a presentation outline on \[Your Topic] for a \[Your Audience] with the goal of \[Your Goal]. Aim for approximately \[Number] slides and suggest incorporating \[Types of Content]." 

The AI will then analyse your input and generate a structured outline within the chat window or directly within your presentation software. This generated content may include:

*   **A title slide** suggestion, potentially with relevant visual ideas and placeholders for your main title and subtitle.
*   **A selection of potential slide layouts**, offering different structures for various content types (e.g., title and content, two content blocks, content with image).
*   **Sample headings and bullet points** as starting points for each section of your presentation, offering guidance on the flow and key messages.
*   Potentially, a **suggested design theme**, including font styles, colour palettes, and visual elements to create a consistent look and feel.

**4. Customise and Refine the Outline.**

Carefully review the AI-generated presentation outline. Adapt the outline to meet your specific needs and preferences by:

*   **Editing the existing slide titles and suggested content** to ensure accuracy and alignment with your detailed knowledge.
*   **Adding new slides** to cover additional points or to break down complex information further.
*   **Rearranging the order of the slides** to create a logical and engaging flow for your audience.
*   **Modifying the design elements**, such as fonts, colours, and images, to match your brand or preferred aesthetic.
*   **Adding specific instructions or prompts** within the slides to remind yourself of key points or visuals you want to include when you develop the full content.

**5. Save and Reuse the Outline.**

Once you are satisfied with the structure of your presentation outline, save it within your presentation software. This saved outline can serve as a valuable starting point for future presentations on similar topics, **saving you significant time** in the initial planning phase and helping to **maintain consistency** in your presentation style and structure. You can easily duplicate and adapt the outline for new content as needed.
