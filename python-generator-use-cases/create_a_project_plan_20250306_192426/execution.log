• Content addresses the reader as "you": Point of view is consistent and avoids third-person references like "business leaders" or "apprentices."
• Content is written in a conversational tone: The tone is action-oriented, clear, and energized. Content should assume the knowledge of an average junior developer and minimize the use of unnecessary jargon. Define any terms or processes that are more complex or advanced.
• Content is in US English: Content follows US spelling, grammar, and punctuation unless written explicitly for a UK-based audience.
• Content is concise: Writing is focused and to-the-point.
• Content is broken into digestible sections. Text that is longer than a sentence is broken down into bullets.
• Bullets, headings, and formatting help scanning: Formatting makes content easy to navigate and understand.
• Content is free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors: Writing adheres to professional standards.
• Grammar and punctuation follow the Chicago Manual of Style: There is consistency across all content.
• Sentence case is used for all titles and headings: Titles and headings are formatted with minimal capitalization.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-reliance on AI

Avoid treating AI-generated plans as infallible. Human oversight and domain expertise are crucial for validating and adjusting plans based on real-world constraints and team dynamics[2][4].

### 2. Neglecting Data Quality

AI outputs are only as good as the inputs provided. Ensure that the information given to the AI is accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive[1][5].

### 3. Ignoring Team Input

While AI can generate plans quickly, it's essential to involve team members in the planning process. Their insights and buy-in are crucial for successful execution[1][5].

### 4. Lack of Customization

Generic AI-generated plans may not account for organization-specific processes or industry nuances. Always tailor the AI's output to fit your specific context[2][5].

### 5. Privacy and Security Concerns

Be cautious about inputting sensitive project information into AI tools. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and company policies[5].

• Content is written at an 8th-grade reading level: Content is easy for anyone to understand.
• Content is written in the active voice: Writing empowers learners to find solutions and take action. Passive voice is avoided.
• Content addresses the reader as "you": Point of view is consistent and avoids third-person references like "business leaders" or "apprentices."
• Content is written in a conversational tone: The tone is action-oriented, clear, and energized. Content should assume the knowledge of an average junior developer and minimize the use of unnecessary jargon. Define any terms or processes that are more complex or advanced.
• Content is in US English: Content follows US spelling, grammar, and punctuation unless written explicitly for a UK-based audience.
• Content is concise: Writing is focused and to-the-point.
• Content is broken into digestible sections. Text that is longer than a sentence is broken down into bullets.
• Bullets, headings, and formatting help scanning: Formatting makes content easy to navigate and understand.
• Content is free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors: Writing adheres to professional standards.
• Grammar and punctuation follow the Chicago Manual of Style: There is consistency across all content.
• Sentence case is used for all titles and headings: Titles and headings are formatted with minimal capitalization.
• Numbers, dates, times, percentages, and money are consistently formatted: Words are used for numbers zero through nine, numerals for 10 and above, dates follow "Month Day, Year," times are formatted like "10:30am," percentages use %, and money uses currency symbols.
• All original sources are cited using Chicago style: Whenever data is referenced, the original source is cited and linked.
• Writing is bias-free: Content depicts diverse perspectives, avoids stereotypes, and uses gender-neutral terms. Militaristic, exclusionary language is not used. (eg: "sale representative" vs "salesman")
• Writing avoids outdated or inappropriate acronyms: Precise terms are used when referring to specific groups. ("Permit list" vs "Whitelist")
• Writing uses asset-based, specific language: Writing focuses on strengths and potential rather than deficits. (eg: "learners with additional learning needs" vs "special needs learners")

BRAND GUIDELINES:

• Content is written at an 8th-grade reading level: Content is easy for anyone to understand.
• Content is written in the active voice: Writing empowers learners to find solutions and take action. Passive voice is avoided.
• Content addresses the reader as "you": Point of view is consistent and avoids third-person references like "business leaders" or "apprentices."
• Content is written in a conversational tone: The tone is action-oriented, clear, and energized. Content should assume the knowledge of an average junior developer and minimize the use of unnecessary jargon. Define any terms or processes that are more complex or advanced.
• Content is in US English: Content follows US spelling, grammar, and punctuation unless written explicitly for a UK-based audience.
• Content is concise: Writing is focused and to-the-point.
• Content is broken into digestible sections. Text that is longer than a sentence is broken down into bullets.
• Bullets, headings, and formatting help scanning: Formatting makes content easy to navigate and understand.
• Content is free of spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors: Writing adheres to professional standards.
• Grammar and punctuation follow the Chicago Manual of Style: There is consistency across all content.
• Sentence case is used for all titles and headings: Titles and headings are formatted with minimal capitalization.
• Numbers, dates, times, percentages, and money are consistently formatted: Words are used for numbers zero through nine, numerals for 10 and above, dates follow "Month Day, Year," times are formatted like "10:30am," percentages use %, and money uses currency symbols.
• All original sources are cited using Chicago style: Whenever data is referenced, the original source is cited and linked.
• Writing is bias-free: Content depicts diverse perspectives, avoids stereotypes, and uses gender-neutral terms. Militaristic, exclusionary language is not used. (eg: "sale representative" vs "salesman")
• Writing avoids outdated or inappropriate acronyms: Precise terms are used when referring to specific groups. ("Permit list" vs "Whitelist")
• Writing uses asset-based, specific language: Writing focuses on strengths and potential rather than deficits. (eg: "learners with additional learning needs" vs "special needs learners")

Next, prompt Gemini to break down your project into 5-7 key milestones with actionable tasks, including deadlines and estimated durations. Then, instruct the model to assign generic roles (such as Project Manager, Developer, QA) and generate a realistic timeline while accounting for task dependencies and potential risks. After reviewing the initial draft, use follow-up prompts to refine the details and ensure consistency with industry standards like PMBOK. Finally, run a Python code snippet that uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to export your plan in CSV format, ready for import into Google Sheets. This approach guarantees that your plan is both actionable and seamlessly integrated into your workflow, highlighting best practices and error-checking at every step."
