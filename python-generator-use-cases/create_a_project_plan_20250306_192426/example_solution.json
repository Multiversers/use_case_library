Next, prompt Gemini to break down your project into 5-7 key milestones with actionable tasks, including deadlines and estimated durations. Then, instruct the model to assign generic roles (such as Project Manager, Developer, QA) and generate a realistic timeline while accounting for task dependencies and potential risks. After reviewing the initial draft, use follow-up prompts to refine the details and ensure consistency with industry standards like PMBOK. Finally, run a Python code snippet that uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to export your plan in CSV format, ready for import into Google Sheets. This approach guarantees that your plan is both actionable and seamlessly integrated into your workflow, highlighting best practices and error-checking at every step.\"\n}"
