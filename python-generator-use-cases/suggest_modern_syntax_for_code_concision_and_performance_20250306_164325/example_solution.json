In this demo, you'll see how to modernize legacy code using GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet 3.7. First, launch Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022 (make sure you're on version 17.13 or later) and confirm that GitHub Copilot is enabled. Open the Copilot chat window and select 'Claude Sonnet 3.7' using the model picker\\u2014this should take about three minutes. Next, analyze your legacy code by asking, for example, 'Review this code snippet and identify inefficient or deprecated constructs,' and inspect a verbose function that filters even numbers. Watch as Copilot highlights outdated loops and patterns. Then, generate refactoring suggestions by prompting, 'How can I refactor the above code to use modern Python 3.9+ features for better concision and performance?' Once you receive the suggestions, apply the changes incrementally\\u2014transforming a loop into a list comprehension\\u2014and run your tests to ensure everything still works. Finally, update the documentation with comments explaining these changes and commit the refactored code using a clear commit message. This walkthrough demonstrates how to leverage AI tools to produce concise, high-performance code enhancements in a fast, reliable manner.\"\n}"
