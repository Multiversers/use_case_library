# Suggest modern syntax for code concision and performance

**Time to Complete:** 20 minutes

## Description
Use AI coding assistants to analyze your existing code and suggest modern language features and optimizations. This will help you make your code concise and perform better, bridging the gap between older codebases and new language standards.

## Steps
### Step 1: Set up your development environment
Make sure your development environment is ready with Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022 (v17.13+) and GitHub Copilot. Open your editor, confirm that Copilot is enabled, and choose Claude Sonnet 3.7 from the model picker. This setup should take about 3 minutes.

1. **Key actions**
   - Verify installation of VS Code/Visual Studio
   - Open the GitHub Copilot chat window
   - Select Claude Sonnet 3.7 using the model picker

Ensure your installation is up-to-date and configured correctly to access advanced features.

### Step 2: Analyze legacy code
Use GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet 3.7 to perform static analysis on your old code. Look for outdated constructs or verbose patterns to refactor. Spend about 5 minutes on this task.

1. **Key analysis points**
   - Identify repetitive code patterns
   - Locate inefficient algorithms
   - Spot deprecated language constructs

Focus on critical sections of the code that would benefit most from modernization.

### Step 3: Generate refactoring suggestions
Ask the AI coding assistants to suggest modern syntax improvements for sections of your old code. For instance, ask 'How can I refactor this code to use modern Python 3.9+ syntax?' Plan to spend around 5 minutes on this.

1. **Prompting strategy**
   - Use the chat interface to provide context
   - Specify the target language version and desired improvements
   - Request explanations for the suggested changes

Combine GitHub Copilot’s quick completions with Claude Sonnet 3.7’s detailed analysis for optimal suggestions.

### Step 4: Apply and benchmark changes
Implement the AI-suggested changes in small steps. Test to ensure everything works and benchmark improvements in code concision and performance. Set aside about 5 minutes for this.

1. **Implementation steps**
   - Apply changes in small increments
   - Run tests to verify functionality
   - Benchmark performance metrics such as code length, cyclomatic complexity, and runtime efficiency

Monitor performance metrics closely and revert any changes that negatively impact performance.

### Step 5: Document and commit
Use AI-generated insights to update documentation and add comments explaining the refactored code. Finish with a clear commit message. This should take around 2 minutes.

1. **Documentation actions**
   - Update code comments to reflect modernized syntax
   - Document refactoring decisions and performance benefits
   - Commit changes with clear and detailed messages

Good documentation aids team understanding and ensures maintainability of the modernized code.

## Example Solution: Suggest modern syntax for code concision and performance

**Setup Time:** 3 minutes  
**Demo Time:** 3 minutes

### Scenario
Modernize a legacy codebase by leveraging GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet 3.7 to refactor verbose constructs into concise, modern coding patterns that improve performance and readability.

### Prerequisites
* Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022 (v17.13+)
* GitHub Copilot installed and enabled
* Access to the GitHub Copilot chat window
* Basic familiarity with legacy code and refactoring

### Demo Steps
1. **Set up your development environment**
```
Open Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022 (v17.13+). Confirm GitHub Copilot is installed and enabled. Then, open the Copilot chat window and use the model picker to select 'Claude Sonnet 3.7'.
Example prompt: 'Set up Copilot with Claude Sonnet 3.7 as the active model.'
```
2. **Analyze legacy code**
```
Use GitHub Copilot to perform static analysis on your legacy code. Identify sections with outdated constructs or verbose patterns.
Example prompt: 'Review this code snippet and identify inefficient or deprecated constructs:'

# Legacy Example

def filter_even(numbers):
    result = []
    for n in numbers:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            result.append(n)
    return result
```
3. **Generate refactoring suggestions**
```
Ask the AI coding assistants to suggest modern syntax improvements.
Example prompt: 'How can I refactor the above Python code to use modern Python 3.9+ features for improved concision and performance? Please explain the benefits of each change.'
This combines quick completions from Copilot with the detailed analysis from Claude Sonnet 3.7.
```
4. **Apply and benchmark changes**
```
Implement the AI-suggested changes incrementally. For example, refactor the code as follows:

# Modernized Code

def filter_even(numbers):
    return [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

Run unit tests to ensure functionality remains intact. Use profiling tools to benchmark performance improvements and measure reductions in code length and cyclomatic complexity.
```
5. **Document and commit**
```
Update inline documentation and code comments to reflect the refactoring changes.
Example commit message: 'Refactored legacy filtering function to use list comprehension for improved concision and performance.'
Ensure that documentation explains the rationale behind the modernized syntax.
```

### Validation
* Run comprehensive unit tests to verify that refactored code functions as expected.
* Benchmark performance (execution time and resource usage) before and after changes.
* Verify that code documentation clearly outlines the modernizations and their benefits.

### Key Teaching Points
* Utilize GitHub Copilot for quick code completions and Claude Sonnet 3.7 for thorough analysis.
* Static analysis helps pinpoint outdated or inefficient code sections.
* Incremental changes combined with proper testing ensure safe refactoring.

### Common Issues to Watch For
* Tool version mismatches or outdated installations leading to configuration errors.
* AI suggestions that may require manual adjustments for project-specific coding standards.
* Potential performance regressions if changes are not properly benchmarked and tested.

### Demo Script
Hi there! In this demo, you'll see how to modernize legacy code using GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet 3.7. First, launch Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022 (make sure you're on version 17.13 or later) and confirm that GitHub Copilot is enabled. Open the Copilot chat window and select 'Claude Sonnet 3.7' using the model picker—this should take about three minutes. Next, analyze your legacy code by asking, for example, 'Review this code snippet and identify inefficient or deprecated constructs,' and inspect a verbose function that filters even numbers. Watch as Copilot highlights outdated loops and patterns. Then, generate refactoring suggestions by prompting, 'How can I refactor the above code to use modern Python 3.9+ features for better concision and performance?' Once you receive the suggestions, apply the changes incrementally—transforming a loop into a list comprehension—and run your tests to ensure everything still works. Finally, update the documentation with comments explaining these changes and commit the refactored code using a clear commit message. This walkthrough demonstrates how to leverage AI tools to produce concise, high-performance code enhancements in a fast, reliable manner.
