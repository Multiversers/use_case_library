### Demo Script
Welcome to this demo on creating a custom spreadsheet formula using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash in Google Workspace. First, we set up our environment by loading our API key from the .env file and validating its presence. You will see a simple Python script that prints a success message once the API key is loaded. Next, we configure our integration by importing the google.generativeai library and initializing the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. We then write a detailed prompt describing the desired spreadsheet functionality—specifically, a formula that sums sales over the past 30 days. The script sends this prompt to the model and prints the generated formula. Following that, we integrate the formula into our test Google Sheet using the gspread library. We update a specific cell and instruct you to validate the outcome by checking the cell's content with sample data. Finally, we document the entire process by logging both the prompt and the generated formula for future reference, including a note on error handling using IFERROR. This step-by-step guide, demonstrated over a 2-3 minute walkthrough, showcases best practices for leveraging Google Gemini to automate spreadsheet tasks efficiently and reliably.
