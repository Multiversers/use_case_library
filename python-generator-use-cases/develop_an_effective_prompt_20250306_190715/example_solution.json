In the first step, you define the task by providing detailed context \\u2013 for example, analyze Q4 sales data using our Sales report, Market analysis, and Customer data. Next, you incorporate multimodal inputs by attaching visuals such as a trend graph screenshot from Google Sheets and a diagram from Google Slides. In the third step, you decompose the task into actionable steps like setting clear goals, outlining procedures, and specifying outputs. Then, you assign a role to the AI by instructing it to act as a senior data analyst, ensuring domain-specific responses. You iterate on the prompt based on feedback, refining and clarifying instructions to enhance output quality. Finally, you measure performance using defined KPIs such as response accuracy, task completion time, and interaction count. This walkthrough, complete with production-ready code and prompt examples, demonstrates best practices for leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash\\u2019s advanced capabilities in a Google Workspace environment. Enjoy watching how each step seamlessly builds toward a clear, effective prompt!\"\n}"
