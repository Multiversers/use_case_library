# Develop an effective prompt

**Time to Complete:** 20 minutes

## Description
Enhance your interactions with AI to achieve better results and quicker task completion. This guide shows how to create effective prompts using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash within Gemini for Google Workspace. You'll learn to design prompts that are clear, specific, and iterative, utilizing multimodal input, role-based instructions, and measurable performance metrics.

## Steps
### Step 1: Define the task and provide context
Identify the specific task for the AI and supply detailed background information. Use Google Workspace documents or data sources for clear context.

1. **List data sources**
   Identify and list relevant documents like sales reports or market analysis.
   - Sales report
   - Market analysis
   - Customer data

2. **Specify context**
   Describe the scenario or background for the AI.

Be specific about the context so the AI understands it well.

### Step 2: Incorporate multimodal input
Add visuals like images or charts to your prompt for better AI interpretation of complex data.

1. **Attach visuals**
   Include relevant visuals from Google Workspace that support your task.
   - Screenshot of a trend graph
   - Diagram from Google Slides

Use visuals alongside text data, especially for graphical analysis tasks.

### Step 3: Decompose tasks into manageable steps
Break down the overall task into smaller, clear sub-tasks for better AI guidance and accuracy.

1. **Create bullet list**
   List each sub-task with clear goals.
   - Define goals
   - Outline procedures
   - Specify expected outputs

A step-by-step breakdown minimizes ambiguity and ensures thoroughness.

### Step 4: Utilize role-based prompting
Assign a role or persona to the AI to guide its responses and specify the output format.

1. **Format output**
   Include instructions for the output format, like bulleted lists or structured explanations.
   - Clear points
   - Concise explanations

Role-based prompts make AI responses more task-relevant.

### Step 5: Iterate and refine prompt
Review the AI's response and refine your prompt for better clarity and quality.

1. **Use feedback loop**
   Make iterative improvements based on the AI's responses.

Refining iteratively can cut interaction needs by up to 50% and enhance accuracy.

### Step 6: Measure performance and outcomes
Set and track metrics like accuracy and time-to-completion to evaluate prompt effectiveness.

1. **Establish metrics**
   Define key performance indicators like response accuracy and task completion time.
   - Response accuracy
   - Task completion time
   - Interaction count

Regularly reviewing these metrics helps optimize your prompt strategy continuously.

## Example Solution: Develop an effective prompt

**Setup Time:** 5 minutes  
**Demo Time:** 3 minutes

### Scenario
A company wants to optimize its AI-driven report generation. Using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash within Gemini for Google Workspace, you will create effective prompts that guide the AI to analyze sales and market data, producing actionable insights for marketing strategies.

### Prerequisites
* Google Workspace account with Gemini for Google Workspace enabled
* Configured environment with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
* Access to shared documents (Sales report, Market analysis, Customer data)
* Familiarity with prompt engineering best practices

### Demo Steps
1. **Define the task and provide context by specifying the objective and listing relevant data sources.**
```
Task: Analyze Q4 sales data. Context: Use our shared Google Drive documents such as the Sales report, Market analysis, and Customer data. Example prompt: 'Using the Q4 sales report, analyze the top-performing products and suggest effective marketing strategies for Q1, incorporating insights from our market analysis and customer data.'
```
2. **Incorporate multimodal input by adding supporting visuals alongside text to enrich context.**
```
Prompt: 'Attach a screenshot of the trend graph from Google Sheets and include a diagram from Google Slides. Analyze the trend graph on slide 5 of the "2023 Market Analysis" presentation to explain which factors drove recent sales growth.'
```
3. **Decompose tasks into manageable steps by breaking the overall task into clear sub-tasks for better guidance.**
```
Prompt: 'List sub-tasks as follows: 1. Define goals, 2. Outline procedures, 3. Specify expected outputs. For example, create a report by: (a) summarizing sales data, (b) identifying top products, and (c) recommending targeted marketing strategies.'
```
4. **Utilize role-based prompting by assigning a specific role to the AI to tailor its response.**
```
Prompt: 'You are a senior data analyst with expertise in marketing analytics. Provide a detailed analysis of Q4 sales including clear, bulleted insights and actionable recommendations that align with our current market trends.'
```
5. **Iterate and refine the prompt by reviewing the AI's response and adjusting the instructions for clarity and detail.**
```
Prompt: 'Review your initial analysis report and refine it by adding more detailed marketing strategies and clarifying any ambiguous points. Adjust the prompt iteratively to improve response quality.'
```
6. **Measure performance and outcomes by setting specific metrics to validate the AI output and interaction efficiency.**
```
Prompt: 'Define KPIs such as response accuracy (%), task completion time (minutes), and interaction count. Evaluate whether the AI response meets these metrics and adjust the prompt as needed.'
```

### Validation
* Check that the AI response references all specified data sources and visuals.
* Ensure the task breakdown results in a coherent, step-by-step analysis.
* Confirm that role-based instructions produce domain-specific responses.
* Verify that iterative prompt refinements lead to more detailed and accurate outputs.
* Measure output using defined KPIs such as accuracy, completion time, and interaction count.

### Key Teaching Points
* Provide clear and specific context
