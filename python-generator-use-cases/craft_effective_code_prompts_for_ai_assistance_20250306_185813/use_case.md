# Craft Effective Code Prompts for AI Assistance

**Time to Complete:** 20 minutes

## Description
This use case guides you on how to use AI tools by writing precise comments and docstrings that serve as effective prompts for automated code generation. By following research-backed guidelines, you will learn to create clear, detailed function descriptions and specific TODO comments to express your algorithmic intent. This process highlights the importance of natural language clarity, iterative prompt refinement, and validating AI-generated outputs to ensure they match your original intent.

## Steps
### Step 1: Write detailed function docstring
Compose a comprehensive docstring that explains the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples. Ensure your description is clear and concise to guide the AI effectively.

1. **Clear function purpose**
   Begin with a high-level overview of what the function does.
   - Provide a concise summary.
   - State the main responsibility of the function.

2. **Parameter details**
   List each parameter with its type, acceptable range, and purpose.
   - Include default values if applicable.
   - Clarify expected input for each parameter.

3. **Return values**
   Describe the format and type of the value returned by the function.
   - Indicate any special cases or edge conditions.
   - Provide clarity on the expected output.

Ensure that your docstring adheres to common documentation conventions and serves as a clear prompt for AI code generation.

### Step 2: Add specific TODO comments
Insert inline TODO comments that outline specific algorithmic requirements and constraints. Use clear language to define the tasks that need to be completed.

1. **Specific action items**
   Detail what needs to be implemented with clear and actionable instructions.
   - List precise tasks to be completed.
   - Avoid vague descriptions.

2. **Context and constraints**
   Provide background information and mention any constraints related to the algorithm.
   - Include performance or error handling requirements.
   - Reference relevant documentation if necessary.

Detailed TODO comments guide the AI to generate code that meets your original specifications.

### Step 3: Describe complex logic in natural language
Before implementation, write out the logic behind complex parts in plain language to ensure that the AI understands the intended approach.

1. **Break down the logic**
   Outline the sequential steps of the algorithm in simple language.
   - Explain the reasoning behind each step.
   - Detail expected behavior and edge cases.

This approach enhances AI understanding and leads to more accurate code generation for complex tasks.

### Step 4: Refine your prompts based on initial output
Review the AI-generated code and adjust your prompts by adding more details or clarifications to address any shortcomings.

1. **Review initial output**
   Analyze the first version of the generated code to spot any misalignments with your intended functionality.
   - Identify missing features or discrepancies.
   - Note areas that require more detail.

2. **Iterative improvement**
   Modify your prompts and comments based on the review to refine the generated output.
   - Incorporate targeted feedback into your comments.
   - Focus on specific aspects that need clarification.

Iterative refinement of your prompts greatly enhances the accuracy and quality of the AI-generated code.

### Step 5: Validate the generated code
Test and review the AI-generated code to ensure it meets the functional, quality, and performance requirements.

1. **Conduct code review**
   Manually review the code for correctness, readability, and adherence to coding standards.
   - Inspect for any errors or oversights.
   - Ensure the documentation is complete.

2. **Perform testing**
   Develop and run test cases to verify that the code works as expected under various scenarios.
   - Use unit tests and integration tests.
   - Evaluate performance and edge case handling.

Thorough validation through review and testing ensures that the AI-generated code aligns perfectly with your original intent.

## Example Solution: Craft Effective Code Prompts for AI Assistance

**Setup Time:** 3 minutes  
**Demo Time:** 3 minutes

### Scenario
A front-end developer utilizes GitHub Copilot in inline chat mode powered by GPT-4o to iteratively generate and improve Python code. The developer writes detailed docstrings, adds specific TODO comments, clearly explains complex logic in plain language, refines prompts based on initial outputs, and validates the final code through testing.

### Prerequisites
* Writing clear code comments
* Understanding code structure
* Basic algorithmic thinking
* Familiarity with code completion tools
* Basic understanding of natural language processing

### Demo Steps
1. **Write detailed function docstring: Compose a comprehensive Python function docstring that details the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples to guide the AI.**
```
def calculate_discounted_price(price, discount):
    """
    Calculate the final price after applying a discount.

    Parameters:
        price (float): The original price of the item. Must be non-negative.
        discount (float): Discount rate as a float between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.20 for 20% discount).

    Returns:
        float: Final price after discount. Returns 0 if discount is 1.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_discounted_price(100.0, 0.2)
        80.0
    """
    return price * (1 - discount)
```
2. **Add specific TODO comments: Insert inline TODO comments that clearly outline specific algorithmic tasks and constraints.**
```
def fetch_user_data(user_id: int) -> dict:
    """Fetch user data from the database using a unique user ID."""
    # TODO: Establish a secure connection to the user database
    # TODO: Execute an SQL query to retrieve user details
    # TODO: Implement error handling for connection timeouts and query failures
    # TODO: Validate the format of the returned data
    return {}
```
3. **Describe complex logic in natural language: Explain the detailed logic behind a function in plain language to ensure clarity before implementation.**
```
def sort_numbers(numbers: list) -> list:
    """Sort a list of numbers using the merge sort algorithm."""
    # The merge sort algorithm works as follows:
    # 1. If the list has zero or one element, it is already sorted.
    # 2. Divide the list into two nearly equal halves.
    # 3. Recursively sort each half.
    # 4. Merge the two sorted halves by comparing the smallest elements from each.
    # 5. Return the fully merged and sorted list.
    if len(numbers) <= 1:
        return numbers
    mid = len(numbers) // 2
    left = sort_numbers(numbers[:mid])
    right = sort_numbers(numbers[mid:])
    sorted_list = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            sorted_list.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            sorted_list.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    sorted_list.extend(left[i:])
    sorted_list.extend(right[j:])
    return sorted_list
```
4. **Refine your prompts based on initial output: Review the AI-generated code and adjust your prompts with added clarifications for error handling and edge cases.**
```
# Initial review of the fetch_user_data function revealed missing input validation and error handling for invalid user IDs.
# Refined prompt for GitHub Copilot:
"@copilot, update the fetch_user_data function to include validation that the user_id is a positive integer and add try-except blocks to handle potential database errors."
```
5. **Validate the generated code: Test and review the code to ensure it meets functional requirements and handles edge cases appropriately.**
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Validate calculate_discounted_price function
    result = calculate_discounted_price(100.0, 0.2)
    print('Discounted Price:', result)  # Expected output: 80.0

    # Validate sort_numbers function
    test_numbers = [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]
    sorted_numbers = sort_numbers(test_numbers)
    print('Sorted Numbers:', sorted_numbers)  # Expected sorted list: [5, 7, 23, 32, 34, 62]

    # Further testing and manual code review should be performed to ensure all edge cases and error handling are in place.
```

### Validation
* Run the main block to verify the expected outputs for each function.
* Inspect inline comments and TODO items to confirm they guide the AI effectively.
