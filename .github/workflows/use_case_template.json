  "objective": "Implement a systematic validation process for AI-generated code that catches logical errors and security flaws while maintaining development velocity.",
  "description": "Perhaps the most important skill: code review for AI suggestions. AI can produce syntactically correct code that does not actually solve the problem or introduces bugs. Studies have shown that code generated by AI might run without errors but still fail logic or security requirements in many cases (Developers with AI assistants need to follow the pair programming model - Stack Overflow). A good developer treats the AI as a junior programmer: always review the code, run tests, and ensure it meets standards. This includes understanding common failure modes of AI code: using obsolete or incorrect APIs, producing inefficient solutions, or even including fictitious functions that don't exist (Developers with AI assistants need to follow the pair programming model - Stack Overflow).",
