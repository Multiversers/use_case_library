**Demo Script: Debugging Uncaught Exceptions with GitHub Copilot in VS Code**

**Introduction:**

- Begin with a brief introduction to the importance of handling uncaught exceptions in Node.js applications and how GitHub Copilot can assist in identifying and resolving such issues.

**Step 1: Set Up the Environment**

- Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- Create a new file named `app.js`.
- Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system.

**Step 2: Write the Sample Code**

- In `app.js`, input the following code:

  ```javascript
  function processUserInput(input) {
      // Simulate processing user input
      if (input === undefined) {
          throw new Error('User input is undefined');
      }
      return `Processed: ${input}`;
  }

  // Simulate user input
  const userInput = undefined;
  console.log(processUserInput(userInput));
  ```


- Explain that this code simulates processing user input and intentionally throws an error when the input is undefined.

**Step 3: Run the Code and Observe the Error**

- Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
- Execute the script using the command: `node app.js`.
- Highlight the resulting uncaught exception error message displayed in the terminal.

**Step 4: Utilize GitHub Copilot to Analyze the Issue**

- Select the `processUserInput` function in the code.
- Invoke GitHub Copilot by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, typing `Copilot: Explain Selected Code`, and pressing Enter.
- Review Copilot's explanation of the function and its behavior when the input is undefined.

**Step 5: Implement Copilot's Suggested Fix**

- Prompt Copilot for a solution by adding a comment like `// Handle undefined input` above the function.
- Accept Copilot's suggestion to modify the function for handling undefined inputs gracefully. The updated function may look like this:

  ```javascript
  function processUserInput(input) {
      // Handle undefined input
      if (input === undefined) {
          console.warn('Warning: User input is undefined. Using default value.');
          input = 'default';
      }
      return `Processed: ${input}`;
  }
  ```


**Step 6: Verify the Solution**

- Save the changes to `app.js`.
- Re-run the script using `node app.js`.
- Confirm that the warning is displayed and the program outputs the processed input without throwing an error.

**Step 7: Reflect on the Process**

- Discuss how GitHub Copilot assisted in identifying and resolving the uncaught exception.
- Highlight the benefits of integrating AI tools like Copilot into the development workflow for efficient debugging and code enhancement.

**Voiceover Consideration:**

Including a voiceover in your demo can enhance viewer engagement and comprehension. It allows you to explain each step clearly and provide insights that may not be immediately evident through visuals alone. While some tutorials rely solely on on-screen text, a natural human voice often resonates better with audiences and can make the content more accessible. citeturn0search2

**Conclusion:**

- Summarize the key takeaways from the demo, emphasizing the role of GitHub Copilot in streamlining the debugging process.
- Encourage viewers to integrate such AI tools into their development practices to enhance code quality and efficiency.
